This Privacy Notice is governed by our Terms of Service. Defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Service.

## 1. Who We Are

Nagish Inc. is the data controller responsible for any personal data processed in connection with the Website.

Our guiding principle is data-minimization.  
Whenever feasible, processing happens locally on your device, limiting the amount of information transmitted across the internet.  
Remote processing is performed only when necessary to deliver high-quality translation and accessibility features.

---

## 2. What Data We Collect and Why

When you submit text for translation, our backend records the request, a salted-and-hashed version of your IP address, the target and source language, and diagnostic details that help us keep the service reliable and secure.  
For the spoken-to-signed translation feature, the full input is logged because we need it to evaluate and improve sign-language rendering quality.  
These logs reside in Google Cloud Logs and Google BigQuery on encrypted storage and are automatically deleted once they are no longer operationally required.

If you opt in through our cookie banner, we gather aggregated analytics such as page paths, browser type, device category, and language settings.  
This data, processed through Google Analytics, helps us understand overall usage patterns and prioritise product improvements.  
Declining or later withdrawing consent stops analytics collection immediately.

Certain advanced features—specifically text normalization and vocalization—send your input to OpenAI’s ChatGPT API for processing.  
These requests are covered by the [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

## 3. Legal Bases for Processing

We rely on performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to deliver translations you explicitly request.  
Diagnostic logging is processed under our legitimate interests in maintaining service integrity under Article 6(1)(f).  
Analytics and optional features that send data to third parties are processed on the basis of your explicit consent under Article 6(1)(a).  
You may revoke consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing carried out before withdrawal.

## 4. Data Security

All information is stored on encrypted infrastructure hosted on Google Cloud.  
Access is restricted to authorized personnel, and all third-party providers operate under GDPR-aligned data-processing agreements.

---

## 5. International Transfers

Where data leaves the EEA—including transfers to the United States—we rely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and comparable Swiss mechanisms to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection as required by GDPR and FADP.

---

## 6. Your Rights

You have the right to request access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and portability of your personal data, as well as the right to object to certain processing activities.  
Please note that because we anonymize request logs and remove direct identifiers, we may be unable to locate any data that can be linked back to you personally.  
To exercise any of these rights, contact us at [hello&#64;nagish.com](mailto:hello@nagish.com).  
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

## 7. Updates to This Policy

We update this Privacy Policy when our technology, legal obligations, or data-handling practices change.  
The most recent version is always available at [sign.mt](https://sign.mt), and the “Last Update” date above reflects the date of the latest substantive revision.
